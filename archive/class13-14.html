        (13)  installed json-server package to create a fake api endpoint; in assignments.js components we used created lifecycle hook
            to fetch the data and store them in the assignments data property so that vue can render it as before.

        (14)    assignment ui change to vertical position; create task form now under in progress list
                in the assignment list component we used slot so that we can pass the component from assignments.js component
                like: 
                <assignment-list>
                    <assignment-create></assignment-create>
                </assignment-list>

                by using this we can dynamically handle which component to show or hide in another component
                # in assignment list title section we added a close button using &times; to close the component/list
                also to show this dynamically we added a props to assignment list like :
                    canHide: {type: Boolean, default: false},
                    and from assignments.js component we passed the property. like :
                        <assignment-list :assignments="filters.completed" can-hide></assignment-list>

                        so that only this list will have the button that we want to show
                to close the list via clicking close button we first add can-hide props to show the icon then 
                we set showCompleted as a data property(in parent, to control this from parent side) and set the value to false
                then set the div using v-show and 
                    <assignment-list 
                        can-toggle 
                        @toggle="showCompleted = !showCompleted"
                    ></assignment-list>
                here @toggle is event name and v-on:toggle we toggle the value of showCompleted and pass it to children to listen it
                and from children :
                    <button v-show="canToggle" @click="$emit('toggle')">&times;</button>
                response back to parent for the toggle event then it toggles the value of the showCompleted. (may be this is 
                called flags) video shows -> slots and flags to perform this
